That will allow the company ""to focus on software certification and returning the Max to flight,"" Boeing said in a statement. The 737 Max has been grounded worldwide after two 737 Max jets crashed within less than five months. There will be no layoffs in the 737 program and related production teams, and the company is working with customers and suppliers to mitigate any impact, Boeing said. In the same statement, the company said it asked its board of directors to form a committee to review policies and processes for the design and development of the airplanes it builds. Shares of Boeing fell 1.8% in the extended session Friday after ending the regular session down 1%. The stock gained nearly 3% for the week, however, as Wall Street cheered an initial report earlier in the week on the Ethiopia Air crash that found similarities between the March accident and the Lion Air crash in October. Boeing's software fix, expected to be installed in the next few weeks, would thus address the faulty system that contributed to both crashes.",-0.6249,-0.04306363636363635

The air carrier now expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) to be about flat to up 1.0% from a year ago, compared with its previous guidance of flat to up 2.0%. The company also cut its outlook for adjusted pre-tax margin to 2.0% to 4.0% from 2.5% to 4.5%, citing an increase in fuel prices, and said available seat miles for the quarter will be ""slightly higher"" than previous guidance. The company said it cancelled 940 flights during the quarter, as a result of the ""unplanned"" removal of 14 737-800 aircraft made by Boeing Co.

Seifman cut his target to $430, which was 17% above Tuesday's closing price, from $450, while reiterated his overweight rating. Boeing reported Tuesday first-quarter deliveries that dropped 37% from the fourth quarter, as 737 deliveries tumbled 49% as groundings of that aircraft continued. Seifman also cut his 2019 adjusted EPS estimate to $19.35 from $20.60 and his 2020 forecast to $22.30 from $23.50.

As soon as that happened, pilots had to move fast to disengage the system to avoid a nose dive of the jet, a Boeing 737 Max. The automated system, known as MCAS, is the focus for investigators seeking to determine what happened to the Lion Air plane, as well as an Ethiopian Airlines crash of the same Boeing model earlier this month. The two people told the paper that those conducting the testing had not understood the power of the MCAS. Pilots had received only limited training on the system before the first crash and the captain of the Lion Air flight was looking through a technical manual during the final minutes, said the paper. Boeing shares have fallen 13% in the past month as airlines around the world grounded their 737 Max jets and the aerospace giant was forced to stop deliveries.

                                         said late Thursday it has paused deliveries of the 737 Max planes. The aircraft has been grounded worldwide after one of its models was in two deadly crashes in less than five months. Boeing said it will continue to make the 737 Max planes and the delivery halt does not impact its production rate of 52 aircraft a month. Shares of Boeing fell less than 0.1% in the extended session after ending the regular trading day down 1%. U.S. aviation authorities were the last to ground the plane on Wednesday. Wall Street had feared a delivery halt for the commercial jets, although some analysts had said that was likely factored in the share price. Boeing stock has lost 11% this week, and is up 13% in the past 12 months, compared with gains around 2% for the S&P 500 index

A preliminary report earlier Thursday on the causes of the March crash in Ethiopia pointed to a sensor failure triggering an anti-stall feature in the 737 Max, similar to what happened in the October Lion Air crash. Markets have reacted favorably to ""the greater certainty around both a common contributing source of failure and a likely common solution"" for Boeing, the UBS analysts said. The 737 Max fleet will likely take to the skies again around June, the analysts said. Boeing on Thursday apologized for the loss of lives in the two crashes and said it expects to release and implement a software fix in coming weeks. Boeing shares added 3% this week, and are up 17% in the past 12 months, compared with gains around 8.5% for the S&P 500 index.

Of the airlines she covers, Syth said Southwest has the greatest exposure to the grounding of the 737 MAX jets, with 34 aircraft, or about 4% of its total capacity.

Ethiopian authorities stopped short of any final conclusions about the causes of the crash, but confirmed a stall-prevention feature was triggered several times during the six-minute flight, pushing the aircraft's nose down, according to a report on The Wall Street Journal.

The 737 Max jets have been grounded worldwide.

The report from FT comes after Sunday's Ethiopian Airlines crash of a 737 Max 8 jet, which resulted in the deaths of 157 people near Addis Ababa. That crash occurred just about four months after the same model was involved in a separate fatal crash in Indonesia, fueling broader concerns about the safety of those aircraft. However, the specific cause, or causes, of the crashes hadn't been determined. Recent actions to restrict or ban 737 Max 8 and its variants, come despite the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's continued vouching for the safety of the aircraft as American authorities, Boeing and Ethiopian investigators probe the crash. Midday Wednesday, Canada became the most recent country to restrict those model planes from its airspace.

                                         Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg apologized for the loss of lives in the two recent 737 Max crashes and said that it was ""apparent"" that in both flights an anti-stall feature, known as MCAS, activated in error. ""As pilots have told us, erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high workload environment. It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk. We own it and we know how to do it,"" he said in a statement Thursday addressing preliminary findings about Ethiopia Air's crash. Boeing is ""taking a comprehensive, disciplined approach, and taking the time, to get the software update right. We're nearing completion and anticipate its certification and implementation on the 737 Max fleet worldwide in the weeks ahead,"" he said, adding apologies to airlines and passengers for the jets's worldwide grounding. ""We remain confident in the fundamental safety of the 737 Max,"" Muilenburg said. ""When the Max returns to the skies with the software changes to the MCAS function, it will be among the safest airplanes ever to fly."" Earlier Thursday, Ethiopian authorities released an initial report into the crash, saying the pilots of the doomed flight followed emergency procedures approved by Boeing and the stall prevention feature activated several times during the flight, pushing the plane's nose down, similarly to the crash in Indonesia last year. Shares of Boeing added to earlier gains to rise 3%. The stock is up 21% in the last 12 months, which compares with an advance around 9% for the S&P 500 index.

Market shook off lackluster economic reports to head higher, with the New York Fed's Empire State index falling to a reading of 3.7 in March from 8.8 in the prior month, a near two-year low. U.S. industrial production rose by 0.1% in February, below the 0.4% increase expected by economists, according to a MarketWatch poll. January's figure, however, was raised to show a 0.4% drop, rather than a 0.6% decline as previously estimated. On the bright side, job openings in the U.S. rose to 7.58 million in January, the third-highest level on record, according to the Labor Department, while consumer sentiment rose in March to 97.8 from 93.8 in February, according to a preliminary reading of the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index.
