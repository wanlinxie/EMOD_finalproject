The reason, at least initially, is that heavily weighted component The Boeing Company BA has taken an 11% sell-off as of this hour, following the second crash of its 737 MAX in the past 6 months.Over the weekend, all 157 people died aboard a Boeing 737 MAX plane that crashed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This tragedy was chillingly familiar to a similar type crash in Indonesia last October, when 189 people perished. Following the Indonesian crash, there were no augmentations in Boeing’s 10-K filing relating to the Boeing 737 MAX model.Boeing’s 737 is the world’s most successful aircraft in terms of sales. The MAX version was a more recent update that made the planes more fuel efficient. Besides Boeing, airline companies that have recently invested in the plane are all down in today’s pre-market, including Southwest LUV, American AAL and United Continental UAL. In fact, all Chinese, Indonesian and Cayman Islands 737 MAX planes have now been grounded until further notice.For Boeing’s part, today’s pre-market drop has given back all the 9.3% gains the stock has made since Christmas Eve 2018. The aircraft giant had been helping the Dow reach higher highs thus far in 2019, and shares had carried a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) as of Friday’s close. We expect analysts to revise estimates in the coming week.January Retail Sales (Delayed)A new headline on Retail Sales for the month of January (delayed by the long U.S. government shutdown) outperformed expectations: +0.2% from the +0.1% estimate. This is also much better than December’s downwardly revised -1.6% headline.Stripping out ex-auto sales, we see this figure rise to +0.9%, ex-autos & gas +1.2%. The control figure was 1.1%, and this is significant because the December control number — that which strips away near-term volatility — was revised down from the original -1.7% to -2.3% in today’s read. This constitutes the worst monthly control number since the year 2000.Basically, the “wealth effect” — how an individual’s or a household’s investment performance causes them to spend — hit the Retail Sales figures in December hard, as a tumbling stock market dampened consumer sentiment during the holiday shopping season. Now the the market has regained some of its footing (with help from a more dovish stance thus far from the Fed regarding interest rates), we are seeing Retail Sales numbers responding in kind.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

PPI In-Line at +0.2%",0.0,"Wednesday, March 13, 2019Pre-market futures are up at this hour Wednesday morning, with major U.S. indexes in the green along with oil and precious metals. We also begin to catch up on government-based economic reports, which had been delayed over a 5-week shutdown for most of January and part of December last year.Durable Goods Orders for the month of January surprised to the upside in its release this morning: +0.4% on the headline not only outperformed estimates but swung to a solid positive number from negative expectations (-0.1% to -0.6%, depending on who you’re listening to). December’s Durable Goods headline ticked up 10 basis points to +1.3% in the revision. Good numbers here.Stripping out volatile Transportation costs, we do swing back to a negative number: -0.1%. Yet Non-Defense Capital Goods, ex-Aircraft, reached +0.8% and ex-Defense +0.7% — definitely healthy reads, where Pentagon spending looked to be what held January’s figures back. Because these can vary widely month to month, the “core” growth in Durables spending appear to be in a good place… or at least they were two months ago.The February Producer Price Index (PPI) follows yesterday’s in-line Consumer Price Index (CPI), coming in at +0.1%. This is lower than the +0.2% expected, but a neat swing to the positive from the previous month’s -0.1%. Year over year, final demand reached +1.9%, basically level with expectations. Ex-food & energy (also potentially volatile measures) brought +2.5%, which was lower than estimated and below the previous month’s +2.6%.The takeaway here pivots on PPI vs. CPI reads: currently (or last month, at least) Consumer pricing is right where analysts had expected while Producers were trimming their price tags. For those of us who follow these reads, we are in “business as usual” territory, with a slow gradual increase over time on the Consumer side pretty much considered optimum.Boeing 737 MAX UpdateMore regions around thew world continue to ground the Boeing 737 MAX plane due to technical issues that have potentially caused two tragic commercial airline crashes in the past six months.

The integrated North American auto industry — where parts often cross the border several times before finally being installed in an automobile — is now threatened by policy shifts for the business of automakers and suppliers on both sides of the border.This industry generates $1.7 billion in trade per day, but gridlock has dwindled the number of shipments reaching their destinations by roughly half. Popular pickup truck brands like Chevy Silverado GM and Fiat Chrysler’s FCAU Ram trucks are among those to be most deeply affected.The Trump administration has transferred 750 border agents away from commercial processing to deal with growing immigration realities at the southern border, where a new influx of families prepare to cross into the U.S. from various troubled countries in Central and South America.

2019-03-26,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airbus-secures-35b-deal-china-201308365.html,"Airbus Secures $35B Deal from China, Boeing's Loss Rises",0.0,"Amid ongoing controversy regarding Boeing BA 737 Max, its arch rival Airbus Group SE EADSY announced that it has secured a mega deal from China. The order consists of 290 A320-series narrow-body planes and 10 A350 wide-bodies, which amounts to $35 billion at the current list prices.Generally, the commercial carriers select A320neo for their fleet due to its fuel efficiency, ability to carry two tonnes more payload and fly up to 500 nautical miles compared with other aircraft in the same class. Thanks to two engines choice, one from Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. UTX, and another from the LEAP-1A from CFM International, A320neo also lowers emissions and engine noise.Boeing’s Trouble Continues We have noticed worldwide grounding of 737 Max fleet after fatal crashes of two of its jets. At present nearly 350 aircraft of 737 Max variant are grounded due to security concerns, while Boeing is currently trying to find a solution for this problem.Winning back trust of the passengers will be a big challenge for Boeing in the days to come. Garuda, Indonesia’s flag carrier, which ordered 50 737 Max 8 jets at a list price of $4.9 billion in 2014 has send a letter to Boeing cancelling the order for the remaining jets. Garuda just received delivery of one jet since 2014.Single-Aisle Aircraft to Rule the SkyA recent long-term outlook provided by Airbus mentioned the requirement of nearly 37,390 aircraft over the 2018-2037 time frame, out of which nearly 76% or 28,550 aircraft will be of the single-aisle category.It is quite evident that the single-aisle fuel efficient aircraft is going to dominate the sky in the next two decades. Boeing’s 737 Max is a direct competitor of Airbus’ A320 airplanes and both manufacturers control the global single aisle commercial aircraft.Scenario Changing in Airbus’ Favor?Air travel is going to increase on a global scale, and per the new estimates from Airbus, developing markets will see more of this demand surge than the matured ones. Meanwhile, the demand for new aircraft is moving up across all categories, creating opportunities for all manufacturers in the space. While the large category aircraft is dominated by Boeing and Airbus, the 70-130 seat commercial jet market is ruled by the Brazilian aircraft maker — Embraer SA ERJ.Undoubtedly, the demand for single-aisle aircraft will be the largest among all other categories and the fatal crashes of Boeing’s 737 Max jets have raised serious doubts about the quality of the product supplied by Boeing, which in a way proved beneficial for Airbus.Airbus to date has over 6,501 orders for the A320neo from 103 customers across globe. We expect the orders for A320neo will continue to rise, given the current security concerns pertaining to Boeing’s 737 MAX.Price PerformanceSince the crash of first Boeing 737 Max on Mar 10, 2019, to date shares of Boeing have decreased against Airbus’ gain in the same time frame.",0.23517000000000002,0.32239999999999996
