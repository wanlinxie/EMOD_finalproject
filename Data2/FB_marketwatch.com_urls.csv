He sees shopping initiatives on Instagram bringing in potentially $4 billion in advertising revenue by 2021. Nowak cautioned that turning Instagram shopping into a serious revenue generator ""isn't likely to be fast"" as the company needs to innovate on areas like payments in order to create a more seamless buying experience and make it easier for marketers to track whether their campaigns lead to purchases. ""Longer term, a stronger payments offering will also likely be important to monetizing messaging... so once again, monitor Facebook's payments strategy,"" he wrote.

A close above the 200-DMA, which many chart watchers view as a dividing line between longer-term uptrends and downtrends, would be the third time it has done so over the past 3 1/2 months. The two previous closes above the line, on Jan. 31 and Dec. 3, were followed by quick reversals back below the line the next day. The 200-DMA currently extends to $1,730.20, according to FactSet. The last time it closed above the line for at least 2-straight days was on Nov. 9.

The company's login systems ""are designed to mask passwords using techniques that make them unreadable,"" and Facebook has fixed the problem, it said. As a precaution, it will notify the users who had passwords stored that way. The passwords were never visible to anyone outside the company and there's no evidence so far that ""anyone internally abused or improperly accessed them,"" Facebook said. It estimated it will notify hundreds of millions of Facebook Lite users, tens of millions of other Facebook users, and tens of thousands of Instagram users, it said. Shares of Facebook rose 0.5% in late trading Thursday, and have lost about 2% in the past 12 months, which contrasts with gains around 5% for the S&P 500 index.

Analyst Laura Martin cut her rating to hold, after being at buy for at least the past three years. Martin said she worries about the negative financial effects of the company's pivot toward privacy and encrypted messages, growing risks of regulation, and the negative effects on Facebook's brand from ""horrific images"" that are uploaded, such as the recent New Zealand mass shooting, that are technologically difficult to block. ""Together, we believe these risks are causing a Negative Network Effect, as evidenced by senior management departures,"" Martin wrote in a note to clients.

On top of that, sluggish Chinese economic data hurt sentiment to start the session, with official data from Beijing showing that industrial output slowed more than expected in January and February, adding to concerns that the world's second-biggest economy is slowing down.

Cox will not be replaced officially in the near-term, as a reorganization will have the heads of all the major product teams report to Zuckerberg directly. Will Cathcart will take over as head of WhatsApp and Fidji Simo will take over as head of the Facebook app, Zuckerberg said.
