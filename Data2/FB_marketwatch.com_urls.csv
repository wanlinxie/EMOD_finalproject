The two previous closes above the line, on Jan. 31 and Dec. 3, were followed by quick reversals back below the line the next day. The 200-DMA currently extends to $1,730.20, according to FactSet. The last time it closed above the line for at least 2-straight days was on Nov. 9.

The company's login systems ""are designed to mask passwords using techniques that make them unreadable,"" and Facebook has fixed the problem, it said. As a precaution, it will notify the users who had passwords stored that way. The passwords were never visible to anyone outside the company and there's no evidence so far that ""anyone internally abused or improperly accessed them,"" Facebook said. It estimated it will notify hundreds of millions of Facebook Lite users, tens of millions of other Facebook users, and tens of thousands of Instagram users, it said. Shares of Facebook rose 0.5% in late trading Thursday, and have lost about 2% in the past 12 months, which contrasts with gains around 5% for the S&P 500 index.

Analyst Laura Martin cut her rating to hold, after being at buy for at least the past three years. Martin said she worries about the negative financial effects of the company's pivot toward privacy and encrypted messages, growing risks of regulation, and the negative effects on Facebook's brand from ""horrific images"" that are uploaded, such as the recent New Zealand mass shooting, that are technologically difficult to block. ""Together, we believe these risks are causing a Negative Network Effect, as evidenced by senior management departures,"" Martin wrote in a note to clients.

Still, reports that raised some doubts about progress in Sino-American trade negotiations weighed on Wall Street, keeping the buying mood in check. Bloomberg News reported that a meeting on trade between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping was being pushed back to April rather than later this month. On top of that, sluggish Chinese economic data hurt sentiment to start the session, with official data from Beijing showing that industrial output slowed more than expected in January and February, adding to concerns that the world's second-biggest economy is slowing down.

Chris Cox and VP of WhatsApp Chris Daniels are leaving ""as we organize our company to build out the privacy-focused social platform I discussed in my note last week,"" Zuckerberg wrote in a blog post that published immediately after markets closed Thursday afternoon. Cox will not be replaced officially in the near-term, as a reorganization will have the heads of all the major product teams report to Zuckerberg directly. Will Cathcart will take over as head of WhatsApp and Fidji Simo will take over as head of the Facebook app, Zuckerberg said. Javier Olivan, who worked closely with Cox to manage the entire family of apps, will focus on how the different apps should be integrated, Zuckerberg said. Facebook shares fell 1.8% in immediate after-hours trading following the announcement, after declining 1.9% in the regular session.",0.25,0.10857000000000001
