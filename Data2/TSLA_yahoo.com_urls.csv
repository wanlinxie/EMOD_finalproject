2019-03-14,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/auto-stock-roundup-tsla-ties-124212984.html,"Auto Stock Roundup: TSLA Ties Up With China Lenders for Gigafactory, HMC to Recall",0.0,"Tesla, Inc. TSLA is making a consistent progress in developing its flagship Model 3 sedan. The electric vehicle (EV) pioneer has inked a deal with lenders in China to obtain a 12-month facility of up to 3.5 billion yuan ($521 million) for its Gigafactory in Shanghai. This brings Tesla a step closer to the production of its flagship Model 3 sedan via the benefit of its first overseas facility. Also, the past week saw advancement on the EV front as Harley-Davidson, Inc. HOG is all set to enter the kids’ electric bike market through the acquisition of StaCyc Inc.In the same period, Navistar International Corporation NAV reported first-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings per share of 11 cents, meeting the Zacks Consensus Estimate. During the quarter under review, the company recorded revenues of $2.43 billion, up 28% year over year and also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The improvement in revenues was driven by a 50% surge in sales volume of Navistar’s Class 6-8 trucks and buses in the United States as well as Canada.Meanwhile, Japanese auto giant Honda Motor Co., Ltd. HMC has again been embroiled in a recall mess. This time, Honda is likely to recall around 1 million older vehicles in the United States and Canada due to faulty Takata airbag inflators.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Harley-Davidson geared up to penetrate the children’s electric bike market with the acquisition of California-based StaCyc Inc. Founded in 2016, the acquired company designs and sells electric-powered two-wheeled bikes for children. The buyout will broaden Harley’s portfolio to meet customers’ need across varied age brackets.Over the past few years, the U.S.-based motorcycle manufacturer has been struggling to win new purchasers as its core customer base is aging. In many regions, the company is experiencing persistently soft demand in its key market i.e. the United States, which partly affected worldwide retail sales to decline 6.1% year over year to 228,051 units in 2018.Adding StaCyc’s products to Harley’s portfolio will aid the company to gain fresh riders outside its core clientele. Further, StaCyc’s foothold in the United States will provide Harley with a chance to slightly recover its market share in the country. (Read more: Harley Widens Electric Portfolio With StaCyc Acquisition)Harley-Davidson currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here..2.    Tesla has announced that it will ink a deal with lenders in China to acquire a 12-month facility of up to 3.5 billion yuan ($521 million) for its Gigafactory in Shanghai, per Reuters. Lenders in the pact include China Construction Bank Corp., Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co. This credit facility will enable the EV maker inch closer to the production of its flagship Model 3 sedan by dint of its first foreign credit facility.After prolonged negotiations with the China authorities, Tesla got the nod to own the first wholly-owned foreign manufacturing facility in the country and inaugurated the Shanghai factory in January 2019. The Gigafactory will cost approximately $2 billion and is likely to be completed in May 2019.A wholly-owned manufacturing plant will be hugely beneficial to the company. This will help it lower the impact of the U.S.-China trade spat. Moreover, this will allow the company to compete with a fleet of EV startups. (Read more: Tesla Inks Deal With China Lenders for Gigafactory)Tesla currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.3.    Honda is likely to recall around 1 million older vehicles in the United States and Canada, according to Associated Press. The company is likely to recall many of its popular models for the second time as the Takata airbag inflators, installed at the time of the previous recalls, could turn out to be fatal.Ailing vehicles include Honda Accord from 2001 through 2007, CR-V from 2002 through 2006, Civic from 2001 through 2005, Element from 2003 through 2010, Odyssey from 2002 to 2004, Pilot from 2003 through 2008 and Ridgeline from 2006 onward. Other damaged vehicles are Acura luxury models including MDX from 2003 through 2006, EL from 2001 to 2005, TL from 2002 and 2003 and CL from 2003.Per the transport safety agency Transport Canada, affected vehicles include the ones that were previously recalled and others with airbag replacement after collisions. In fact, Takata used ammonium nitrate to create small explosions for inflating the airbags. But the chemical can deteriorate over time due to fluctuating temperatures and high humidity. It can also burn too fast and blow apart a metal container, hurling shrapnel into drivers and passengers.

The company incurred a loss of 74 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.During the reported quarter, Navistar recorded net income of $11 million against net loss of $73 million in the year-earlier period.The company generated $2.43 billion in revenues, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.23 billion. The figure also marks a 28% rise from the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by a 50% expansion in sales volume of Navistar’s Class 6-8 trucks and buses in the United States and Canada.During the reported quarter, net sales and revenues at Navistar’s Truck segment were $1.8 billion, up 44% from the year-ago quarterly figure. The segment recorded $90 million profit against $7 million loss in the comparable quarter last fiscal year. This upside was owing to stronger volume in the company’s core markets, partly offset by higher material and freight costs and the effect of sales of a majority interest in Navistar Defense.Net sales and revenues at Navistar’s Parts segment were $548 million, down 4% from the same period last fiscal year. The segment’s profit was $144 million, up 5% on a year-over-year basis. Results were favored by solid margins and lower inter-company access fees, partly countered by lower BDP volume and higher freight-related expenses.Net sales and revenues at the company’s Global Operations declined slightly to $73 million. Its profit was $6 million versus loss of $7 million recorded in the first-quarter fiscal 2018. Results were backed by higher volume and cost-reduction benefits.Net sales and revenues at Navistar’s Financial Services segment rose to $74 million. It recorded profit of $31 million, up 55% year over year. The segment’s profit improved, courtesy of higher interest margin from better funding strategies and income from an inter-company loan. However, this rise was mitigated by higher depreciation expenses on operating leases.

Per the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (“JAXA”), this partnership and the development of the lunar rover may turn out to be a major contribution to the international space program in the future.Per JAXA, the aim is to launch the lunar rover into space in 2029. However, the development of the rover is still in the preliminary stage but an illustration shows a six-wheel vehicle that is somewhat similar to an armored personnel carrier.Per the Japanese auto giant, which intends to unveil zero-emission fuel cell vehicles as an alternative to gasoline automobiles, this project will offer a chance to test its technologies amid the harsh environment of the moon.For Toyota, which has several accolades to its credit, this space project indeed seems very exciting and challenging.

The company produced 77,100 vehicles (62,950 Model 3 and 14,150 Model S and Model X combined) during the quarter and delivered 63,000 (50,900 Model 3 and 12,100 Model S and X) vehicles.Though deliveries were 110% more than the year-ago quarter, it fell 31% from the fourth quarter. The electric car maker struggled to ship its Model 3 car to customers in Europe and China for the first time despite the massive increase in deliveries in these two countries, which at times exceeded 5x that of prior peak delivery levels (read: ETFs to Watch Post Tesla Q4 Earnings Miss).This has caused a large number of vehicle deliveries to shift to the second quarter. At the end of the first quarter, approximately 10,600 vehicles were in transit to customers globally. Given the lower-than-expected delivery volumes and several pricing adjustments, first-quarter net income is expected to be negatively impacted.However, the company reaffirmed its forecast that it would deliver between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles in 2019.

Like the first two months of 2019, the U.S. auto sales trajectory persistently declined in March. This uninterrupted fall in auto sales has placed automakers, which are already struggling with weakening conditions in other major global markets, in a tight spot. The sales decline was due to consumers abandoning passenger cars for larger and more-comfortable pickup trucks and SUVs as well as soaring vehicle prices and unfavorable interest rates.Among the leading auto manufacturers, Detroit-based General Motors Company GM, which doesn’t report monthly sales anymore, witnessed 7% decline in vehicle sales for first-quarter 2019 from the prior-year quarter. Ford Motor Company F is another auto manufacturer that doesn’t release monthly figures anymore. Per industry data, the company’s sales are projected to fall 5% year over year in March, followed by a 2% decline in the first quarter.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.’s FCAU March sales decreased 7.4% to 200,307 units. Further, monthly sales for Toyota Motor Company TM and Nissan Motor Co. NSANY deteriorated 3.5% and 7.2%, respectively, while Honda Motor Co. Ltd. HMC witnessed a 4.3% increase in sales.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    CarMax Inc.

However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.39 billion.

The average selling price of used vehicles rose 0.3% from the year-ago quarter to $19,978. Comparable store used-vehicle units sold rose 2.8% from the prior-year level. This performance reflects improved conversion, partially offset by lower store traffic.Wholesale vehicle revenues rose 3.1% from a year ago to $543.8 million in the reported quarter. Units sold increased 3.7% year over year to 102,887 vehicles, courtesy of growth in store base.

Myoungshin, a unit of MS Autotech, affirmed that it will buy the land and buildings of the General Motors facility to undertake contract manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs).Notably, General Motors closed one of its four South Korea plants in late May and axed several workers. This move, which was in sync with the automaker’s strategy to restructure operations, eventually gained huge financial support from the South Korea government.Per a provincial government release, Myongshin is part of a consortium, which, to start with, would invest 200 billion won on the factory. The plant will produce 50,000 EVs, starting from 2021 and 150,000 EVs in 2025.Moreover, per the North Jeolla Province government, the electric car factory would create 900 jobs, and another 2,000 at suppliers and other firms. South Korea’s electric car supply chain and free trade deal with the United States and Europe will aid this plant.

This acquisition is likely to combine e-commerce vehicle platform technology of Xevo with the Southfield, MI-based leading supplier of automotive seating and electrical systems, Lear’s proficiency in electronic systems. In other words, this is likely to broaden Lear’s connectivity offerings, with a leading-edge technology platform.Presently, Xevo’s technology is available in more than 25 million vehicles located mainly in the United States. Moreover, there are considerable opportunities for expansion of Xevo’s technology in North America, Europe and Asia.Nevertheless, per the deal, all outstanding shares of Xevo will be acquired by Lear for $320 million. The transaction, which is scheduled to close in second-quarter 2019, is likely to be executed through debt financing.Over the next year, Lear plans to launch a number of programs within Seating and E-Systems segments. Its developmental programs and partnerships along with production contracts are expected to drive financials in 2019. The Xevo acquisition will advance Lear’s leadership position in reshaping the global automotive industry. This will allow Lear to enhance capabilities in software, services and data analytics.

At the beginning of 2019, the U.S. automaker announced restructuring the business to recover money-losing regional operation. At present, automakers are struggling in Europe due to slackening vehicle sales and tightening emission regulations.From the upgraded SUV line-up, Ford will offer Explorer in a PHEV variant, revamped Kuga plug-in hybrid and compact Puma in a mild-hybrid variant. The new Puma will be manufactured at its hub based in Craiova, Romania, and is expected to reach showrooms by the end of the year.Beside SUVs, Ford will launch an all-electric Transit van for the commercial market by 2021. Further, a plug-in hybrid version of the Transit van will be available in the market this year.Apart from upgraded model launches, the company is reviewing operations in Britain, if the country exits from the European Union without a deal. Ford operates two engine factories in Britain. Last month, the company announced that it was moving out of the Russia market, with three plant closures. Beside this, it plans to slash workforce in Germany and the U.K. This automaker currently employs roughly 54,000 people in Europe.Apart from sluggish vehicle sales, mounting costs are hurting Ford’s profitability in the region. With an aim to reduce expenses, it is partnering with peer companies. In January, it announced that it collaborated with Volkswagen AG. Per the partnership, the companies will build commercial vans and pickups, and explore electric and autonomous technological developments.Ford currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.5.    Tesla, Inc.’s TSLA vehicle production and delivery numbers witnessed sequential declines of 10.9% and 31%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2019. It managed to produce roughly 77,100 vehicles — consisting of 62,950 Model 3, and 14,150 Model S and X. Out of the total delivered figure of 63,000 units, Tesla’s Model 3 accounted for 50,900 while Model S and X were 12,100.During the quarter, this electric automaker struggled with Model 3 deliveries to Europe and China, owing to longer transit time. Nevertheless, several analysts anticipated the fall in deliveries as Tesla shifted to international markets with Model 3 for the first time. The company started delivering new Model 3 to China and Europe markets in January and February, amid a slowdown in demand in North America.Tesla’s Model 3 shipments to international markets faced a few bumps in the last quarter, per Reuters. Misprinted labels delayed the shipments’ arrival in Shanghai while it faced unexpected challenges at the Belgian port of Zeebrugge.Longer transit time to deliver in international markets will likely to hurt Tesla’s working capital. The company reported having 10,600 vehicles in transit at the end of the quarter compared with 1,900 in the fourth quarter of 2018.Apart from managing transit time for international shipments, Tesla has to compete with Europe automakers that are launching several versions of electric vehicles, per Reuters.Tesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).PerformanceLast week, all the stocks gained.
