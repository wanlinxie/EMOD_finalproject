Apart from the political implications of this election, the most important fact is that this event is likely to become the most-expensive election worldwide.Despite the fact that it is an India election, especially concerning its people and political outfits, a few U.S. corporates are likely to gain significantly from this mega event, which according to some political analysts is the greatest show on the earth.World’s Most-Expensive ElectionAccording to New Delhi-based Centre for Media Studies, which tracks money flow in Indian elections, the 2019 parliamentary election will cost around $7 billion, unprecedented in the world. As per Opensectrets.org, which tracks money in the U.S. elections, total expenditure for 2016 U.S. presidential election was $6.5 billion.Per Centre for Media Studies, nearly 50% of the estimated $7 billion expenditure in 2019 Indian election will be spend on social networking, advertising (especially online advertising) and traveling and transportation.Growing Tech Momentum in IndiaIndia has the second-largest population after China with more than 1.2 billion population. Out of this, nearly 900 million individuals are eligible for casting mandate in 2019 election. Around 70% of the country’s population is below the age of 35 and extremely tech savvy.Currently, India is home to a young and tech savvy population, which represents strong growth prospects for tech majors. These millennials are the key drivers of growth for Internet-based applications, e-commerce and mobile-transaction related software. The millennials have a strong appetite for new technologies. As this group will comprise 75% of the workforce by 2025, India will surely emerge as a long-term investment bet for tech giants.Economic Momentum to ContinueThe World Bank has projected that India’s economy will grow by 7.3% for fiscal 2018-2019 (India’s fiscal year starts in April and ends in March of the next year) and 7.5% for fiscal 2019-2020. The IMF estimated that India will grow by 7.2% in fiscal 2018-2019, 7.5% in 2019-2020 and 7.7% in 2020-2021.The Moody’s Investor Services forecast India’s GDP growth at 7.2% for 2018-2019 and 7.4% for 2019-2020. Moody’s was optimistic that structural reforms undertaken by the Modi administration are likely to boost growth and reduce the debt burden. Moody’s lifted India’s rating to Baa2 from Baa3 and changed its rating outlook to stable from positive as “risks to its credit profile were broadly balance”.Four Stocks to WatchWe have been able to narrow down to four stocks each of which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) but are poised to gain significantly from the upcoming election in India.

MDLZ have managed to keep their appeal, on the back of prudent strategies. Mondelez, a renowned name in snacking and chocolates, has been gaining from endeavors like cost savings and prudent acquisitions. Let’s take a closer look.Lucrative Measures to Boost PerformanceMondelez prides in its strong portfolio, adorned with popular brands like Cadbury, Toblerone, Milka, Tang powdered beverages and Halls candies amongst others. Moreover, the company has been striving to expand brand strength through buyouts. In July 2018, the company completed the acquisition of 13.8% ownership in the Keurig Dr Pepper business. Prior to this, last June, Mondelez concluded the buyout of Tate’s Bake Shop. Tate’s has been one of the fastest growing biscuit brands in the United States and complements Mondelez’s portfolio. The buyout has been driving revenues for a while. Also, in January 2018, the company teamed up with Post Consumer Brands, a business unit of Post Holdings POST, to create two new cookie-inspired breakfast cereals. The company plans to continue making acquisitions to gain scale in its categories and distribution capabilities.The company is also engaging in innovations and extending brands to newer geographies and platforms. Notably, Mondelez has been striving to expand its snacking portfolio, and has accordingly developed theSnackFutures innovation hub.  As part of this platform, the company recently made investments in Uplift Food, a start-up firm engaged in developing prebiotic functional foods.Further, it is increasing investment toward in-store execution and advertising to support Power Brands. Additionally, to strengthen presence of brand banners across digital media, the company has formed strategic partnerships with biggies like Facebook FB and Amazon AMZN. The company is also improving its presence in high-growth channels like e-commerce, discounters, convenience stores and traditional trade.Apart from this, Mondelez is undertaking major steps to enhance productivity savings that are fueling margins, cash flow and returns on invested capital. Markedly, such initiatives supported the company’sprofitability in the fourth quarter of 2018. During the quarter, productivity savings and higher pricing led to adjusted gross margin improvement of 90 basis points on a year-over-year basis.",0.9945,0.4078827586206896
