""While acquisitions have not been in Apple's core DNA, the clock has struck midnight for Cupertino in our opinion and building content organically is a slow and arduous path, which highlights the clear need for Apple to do larger, strategic M&A (a24, Lionsgate, Sony Pictures, CBS/Viacom, Netflix, MGM) around content over the coming year to ""double down"" and drive the services flywheel especially with its new video subscription service set to be rolled out,"" analyst Daniel Ives said in a note to clients. Apple has announced a March 25 event at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, its headquarters, to announce details of the streaming service, which is not expected to launch until the fall. Ives is hoping the company is planning to use the service to further expand its entire services offering into areas such as video content and even gaming in the next decade.
