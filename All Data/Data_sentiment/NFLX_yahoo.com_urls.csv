The streaming giant’s protectiveness toward its own app has been cited as the primary reason. Notably, Netflix is also not available on Amazon Prime and Roku’s ROKU video subscription marketplace.We also believe that revenue sharing could have been a major issue between Apple and Netflix. The iPhone maker was reportedly pushing for a higher cut in revenue share instead of the rate it usually charges.In fact, Netflix has stopped allowing Apple users to subscribe through the App store billing feature. This has helped the company retain 30% of the revenue share, which Apple used to get previously.Revenue sharing arrangement has also been a bone of contention between Apple and a host of major publishers, including the New York Times and Washington Post, for the upcoming paid news service.
