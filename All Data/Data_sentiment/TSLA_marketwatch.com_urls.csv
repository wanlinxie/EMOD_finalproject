Musk's tweet saying Tesla will make around 500,000 cars in 2019 is viewed by the SEC as breaking its settlement reached in wake of his tweeting out a non-existent takeover bid. Later Thursday, Musk issued a statement saying he was ""pleased"" with the judge's decision, and doubling down on claims his tweet was immaterial to shareholders and not in violation of his agreement with the SEC. ""We have always felt that we should be able to work through any disagreements directly with the SEC, rather than prematurely rushing to court,"" Musk said.

""Tesla is challenged internally by ongoing operational missteps and strategy reversals over a short time period,"" the credit ratings agency said in a note Friday. Other car makers have stepped up electric-vehicle investments and the original business model for the Model 3 of high volume production and a low price is proving difficult to achieve, Moody's said.

If the vehicle captures the same share as the Model X SUV does in its category, it would point to 350,000 to 400,000 units sold, Sacconaghi said. ""To get to ~750k units/year would require Model Y to capture similar share as the Model S (mid-teens), perhaps coupled with Tesla upselling customers from lower-priced segments,"" he said in a note Thursday. The crossover's base price could start around $40,000, but more likely around $55,000 as Tesla will want to manage the price point against cannibalization, he said. Tesla is unlikely to disclose Model Y reservations since they'd be likely lower than initial Model 3 reservations and the company may not want to set a precedent for disclosing orders, Sacconaghi said.

Morgan, citing reports of delays in shipping Model 3s to customers in Europe and China. Brinkman, who reiterated the underweight rating he's had Tesla for at least the past three years, lowered his target to $215, which is 23% below Thursday's closing price, from $230. The stock edged up 0.3% in premarket trade. Brinkman cut his first-quarter Model 3 deliveries estimate to 50,000 from 55,000, which is below the FactSet consensus is 54,600. Tesla is expected to report deliveries next week. He said the first quarter is likely to prove teh ""softest"" for free cash flow, given its status as an expansion quarter, given the Model 3 rollouts in Europe and China. ""Any delays in delivering vehicles to Europe and China carry the potential for a disproportionate impact on 1Q deliveries (and, hence, revenue, margin and cash flow), given the already guided back-end-loaded nature of 1Q deliveries,"" Brinkman wrote in a note to clients.
