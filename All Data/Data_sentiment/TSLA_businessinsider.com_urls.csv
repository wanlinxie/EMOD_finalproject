In a future where companies sell or operate fleets of AVs and all other factors â€” including price, availability, and self-driving tech capabilities â€” the in-car experience could be a key competitive differentiator. Gaming is only one of a variety of entertainment options companies are exploring for use in AVs â€” VR and video streaming will also likely be marquee features â€” but its popularity suggests that it will be a key focus for auto companies as they seek to develop unique offerings. As such, we expect more AV companies to form partnerships with name-brand gaming companies or reach out to previously untapped sources to develop â€” and ultimately monetize â€” new games for their cars, the way Tesla and Mercedes have.

Last year, Tesla, arguably Nvidia's highest-profile customer,  abandoned Nvidia's AV computing systems, instead choosing to build its own chipsets. Nvidia likely fears more of its customers â€” which  include Toyota, Volvo, and Audi â€” could follow suit. Although the risk of automakers bringing chip design and production in-house is likely small in the short term â€” because computing systems take years to develop â€” the long-term risk is significant.
