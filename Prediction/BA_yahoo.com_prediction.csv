2019-04-15,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-secures-14b-deal-modernizing-171505004.html,Boeing Secures $14B Deal for Modernizing B-1 & B-52 Bombers,0.3182,"The Boeing Company BA recently secured a $14.3 billion contract for the modernization, engineering, sustainment and testing of the B-1/B-52 weapon systems. The contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, OH.Per the Flexible Acquisition and Sustainment contract, the modernization services will lead to increased lethality and responsiveness of the B-1 & B-52 Bombers. Work related to the deal will be performed in Oklahoma City, OK, and is expected to get completed by Apr 11, 2029.Advantages of Boeing’s B-1 & B-52 BombersBoeing's B-1 is a long-range, multi-mission, supersonic conventional bomber. It is equipped to carry eight air-launched cruise missiles or 24 SRAMs and up to 24 nuclear bombs or 84 500-pound conventional bombs.The Boeing B-52 primarily provides the U.S. military with immediate nuclear and conventional global strike capabilities. Due to its high mission-capable rate, large payload, long range, persistence and ability to employ both nuclear and conventional precision standoff weapons, the B-52 continues to be a crucial contributor to the U.S. National Security Strategy.Our ViewBoeing's Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment provides technical expertise and integrated fleet support along with a broad spectrum of innovative products and services, which directly support and enhance capabilities of military rotorcrafts. Notably, its proven expertise in the field of aircraft modernization has enabled the company to clinch major deals from Pentagon like the latest one.Boeing’s B-52, U.S. Air Force’s one of the most preferred bombers, is expected to play a primary role in the U.S. nuclear mission at least for another decade. Inevitably, we may expect the company to procure similar contracts from Pentagon in the coming days.Interestingly, last month, the U.S. government proposed its fiscal 2020 defense budget that includes a spending plan of $57.7 billion on aircraft, a massive increase of 166% from the approved fiscal 2019 defense spending on aircraft. If approved, this increased spending provision should usher in more contracts for Boeing’s F/A-18 aircraft program, going ahead.Looking AheadPer Mordor Intelligence, the global military aircraft market is expected to reach a value of $78.1 billion by 2023, wherein bombers and surveillance aircraft are expected to account for 12.5% of the market. This, in turn, will increase demand for bomber aircraft along with the requirement for regular technical services and upgrades. Boeing, being a prominent military aircraft manufacturer, is most likely to benefit from such favorable projections, going forward.Price PerformanceShares of the company have increased 16.7% in the past 12 months against the industry’s decline of 0.5%.",0.5302100000000001,0.4102458333333334
