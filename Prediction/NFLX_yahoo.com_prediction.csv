CSX, have all reported Tuesday afternoon. Results overall are decidedly mixed.Although Netflix outperformed expectations notably on its top and bottom lines -- 76 cents per share as compared with the Zacks consensus 57 cents (8 cents higher than the year-ago 64 cents per share) on $4.52 billion that outpaced the expected $4.49 billion -- weaker subscriber guidance sent shares tumbling directly following the earnings release. Netflix currently sees 5 million added subscribers total for Q2, whereas previously the company had expected nearly that amount from International alone.Average Revenue per User (ARPU) dipped 2% in the quarter, while net additions outperformed expectations: 9.6 million versus 8.9 million forecast. The company noted it also experienced some ""modest near-term"" churn following price increases. As for the entry of Disney+ and other competitors to the streaming entertainment space, CEO Reed Hastings said they will not ""materially affect"" growth at Netflix. Shares had initially fallen 6+% on the news, but have buoyed somewhat since.Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated IBM posted better-than-expected earnings on weaker revenues in its Q1 report Tuesday afternoon: $2.25 per share was a 4-cent beat, and sales of $18.18 billion were beneath the $18.68 billion in the Zacks consensus. This marks the third straight quarter of revenue declines for Big Blue.The company no longer reports a Strategic Imperatives segment, and its Cloud Cognitive space outperformed expectations. Analysts will be interested to hear about plans to integrate IBM's Red Hat acquisition. And full-year earnings guidance has not changed: it remains $13.90 per share.United Airlines put up a big beat on its bottom line, $1.15 per share versus 94 cents expected, on revenues of $9.589 billion which just barely missed the $9.6 billion analysts had been looking for. But shares are up 2.75% after normal trading, perhaps due to these figures performing relatively well considering myriad headwinds in the quarter: a polar vortex, U.S. government shutdown and other issues. Cost per available seat mile has been guided up, from flat to 2% previously to +0.5% to 2.5% now.CSX also outpaced expectations on the bottom line while coming in-line on the top: $1.02 per share bettered the 91 cents expected, on $3.01 billion which was exactly the Zacks consensus. Operating ratio improved in the quarter, with merchandise in-line with expectations but coal +7%. Shares are up 4% in after-hours trading. CSX has not missed an earnings estimate in at least 5 full years.",0.2244928571428571,0.27971052631578947

In the U.S. Streaming segment, the company anticipates to gain 1.6 million subscribers, down 29.8% from the year-ago quarter.Netflix raised prices of all its streaming plans in the United States in early January. Per AP, the price hike range of 13-18% was the highest in the company’s history. Price for Netflix’s most popular plan was increased from $11 to $13 per month. This hike is likely to hurt domestic subscriber growth rate in first-quarter 2019, and can also increase churn rate projections for the second quarter.This is primarily due to increasing competition from the likes of Disney (DIS) and Apple. Disney (DIS) has a bigger content package that it will offer at a lower price. Hulu’s content strength along with price reduction of its basic ad-supported plan to $5.99/month is expected to attract subscribers.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q1 performance is expected to be.International Expansion & Cash Burn to ContinueNetflix’s expanding international footprint is likely to drive results. In the last reported quarter, the company added 7.31 million paid subscribers, better than projections of 6.10 million.Netflix expects to add 7.3 million paid subscribers in the International segment, up 22.1% year over year.

T has divested its 9.5% ownership stake in Hulu — an American entertainment firm that provides over-the-top streaming services — for $1.43 billion (1.09 billion pounds). Post divesture, Hulu will be jointly owned by The Walt Disney Company DIS and Comcast Corporation CMCSA with 60% and 30% stakes, respectively. The joint venture partners have an undisclosed window of time to apportion the buy back shares.The transaction values the online streaming venture at $15 billion and underscores its growing relevance despite declining revenue trends. Hulu is widely expected to lose $1.5 billion in the current fiscal and has undercut its entry-level, ad-supported version by 25% to $6 a month due to stiff competition from Netflix Inc. NFLX and Amazon.com's Prime Video. The business is likely to turn profitable by 2023 or 2024 with a projected subscriber base of 40 million to 60 million, increasing significantly from its current tally of 25 million.On its part, AT&T aims to utilize the sale proceeds to reduce its burgeoning debt burden that swelled to $176.5 billion at year-end 2018 primarily due to the acquisition of Time Warner assets. The company aims to achieve a debt-to-EBITDA range of 2.5x by year-end 2019. Although AT&T expects to reduce debt by utilizing its cash flow and proceeds from the sale of non-core assets, the debt-laden balance sheet is likely to weigh significantly on its coffers.In a concerted effort to focus more on video streaming service, AT&T has decided to restructure its WarnerMedia business and fine tune its operating model with the evolving needs of customers. AT&T has been ramping up its streaming services with the launch of live TV channels DirecTV Now in 2016, and a cheaper live-TV service WatchTV in 2018. With modest success in these ventures and continued subscriber loss in its DirecTV satellite TV business as users tend to shift to Internet video services, AT&T intends to focus more on video streaming content. The company aims to launch an early version of its HBO-led subscription video streaming service later this year while continuing HBO Now as a separate streaming service.AT&T seems to be keen to generate additional revenues from more video content and subsequent ads through these videos. This, in turn, would enable the company to capture a greater market share in the digital ad business and augment its position as a media behemoth with significant presence in the telecommunication sector. However, the stock has lost 10.1% over the past year against the industry’s rally of 5.2%.   Nevertheless, with a focused roadmap, AT&T appears poised to turn the tables in 2019, which is likely to be a decisive year for it. The company is set to benefit from solid momentum in its wireless business and continued 5G deployments in multiple U.S. cities. Whether this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock can indeed meet its set targets and perform to its full potential in the year, remain to be seen.

2019-04-12,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/streaming-losses-hurt-disneys-chances-135601902.html,"Streaming Losses to Hurt Disney's Chances Against AMZN, AAPL",-0.6486,"Disney DIS is showing serious intent to become the closest challenger to Netflix NFLX in the streaming service space, backed by its bigger content package, distributed across three services, namely Hulu, ESPN+ and the upcoming Disney+.However, the company’s profits have been under pressure due to heavy investments in streaming services to survive amid stiff competition from Netflix, Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL. This is now expected to continue at least over the next couple of years.Hulu, ESPN+ & Disney+: Not Profitable NowHulu and ESPN+, two major growth drivers of Disney’s streaming service portfolio, are not expected to report profits any time soon. While Hulu is projected to report operating loss of $1.5 billion in fiscal 2019, ESPN+ is estimated to post operating loss of $650 million in both fiscal 2019 and 2020.Disney expects Hulu to be profitable by fiscal 2023 or 2024. Moreover, paid subscribers are expected between 40 million and 60 million compared with 25 million (23 million paid) at present. On the flip side, the company expects ESPN+ to attract 8-12 million paying subscribers by the end of 2024.Additionally, Disney+ is expected to report loss close to $1 billion in fiscal 2020. The service is expected to attract 60-90 million subscribers and be profitable by fiscal 2024. Notably, the company is expected to spend close to $1 billion in fiscal 2020 and mid-$2 billion in fiscal 2024 on Disney+.Apple, Amazon’s Cash Generating Ability Gives Them an EdgeIncreasing competition in the streaming space is compelling providers, both incumbents like Netflix and Amazon, and new comers like Apple and Disney, to spend more on content and marketing. However, this has led to increased cash burn, which doesn’t bode well for Netflix and Disney investors.Year-to-date Price Performance For instance, Netflix spent almost $13 billion on content in 2018. The company’s streaming content obligations were $19.3 billion at the end of fourth-quarter 2018. Netflix expects free cash outflow rate in 2019 to be similar to that in 2018 ($3 billion).Further, Disney generated free cash flow of $904 million in fourth-quarter 2018 compared with $2.65 billion in the previous quarter. Since the company is expected to increase its investments in steaming service, free cash flow growth remains under pressure.  This is why we believe that Amazon and Apple are well positioned to be the most profitable companies in the streaming market.Notably, Amazon is also spending aggressively to promote Prime Video. However, the company’s strong free cash flow ($19.4 billion for the trailing twelve months ended Dec 31, 2018) generation ability, driven by solid retail business and cloud dominance, is a key catalyst.Apple’s cash trove of $245 billion positions it well to support its upcoming Apple TV+ service.  Moreover, the company’s strong installed base of more than 1.4 billion active devices is a key differentiator.Zacks RankWhile both Apple and Netflix currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, Disney currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).",0.4479866666666667,0.43188636363636373
