                                         after an incident earlier this month. An ""anomaly"" previously disclosed ""has resulted in the total loss of the Intelsat 29e spacecraft,"" the satellite company said. A review board has been convened to go over the incident alongside Boeing, Intelsat said. The Intelsat 29e propulsion system leaked on April 7, resulting in a service disruption to customers on the satellite, the company said. While working to recover the satellite, a second problem occurred ""after which all efforts to recover the satellite were unsuccessful,"" the company said. Restoration paths on other Intelsat satellites and third-party satellites have been provided for a majority of the disrupted services. Shares on Intelsat fell 1.8% in the extended session after ending the regular trading day up 1.4%. Boeing shares were flat after closing 0.7% higher on Thursday. ",-0.11468888888888887,-0.1002
